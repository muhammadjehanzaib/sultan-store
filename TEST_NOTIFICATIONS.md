## 🔧 Why Emails Only Go to jehanzaib364@gmail.com

**Resend Test Mode Restriction:**
- Your Resend API key is in test mode
- Test mode only allows sending to your verified email address
- This is normal and expected for development

## 🚀 To Enable Production Emails

When ready for production:
1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Add and verify your domain (e.g., saudisafety.com)
3. Update the `from` address to use your verified domain
4. Set `NODE_ENV=production` in environment variables
