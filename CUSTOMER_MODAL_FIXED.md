# ✅ Customer Modal Issue - FIXED

## 🔍 Issue Identified

The customer modal was showing a blank page when clicking "View" or "Edit" because:

1. **Limited Customer Data**: There were very few customers in the database
2. **Missing Loading State**: The modal wasn't handling the loading state properly
3. **Empty Customer Orders**: Most customers had no associated orders

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced CustomerModal Component
- **File**: `src/components/admin/CustomerModal.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added proper loading state with spinner
  - Better handling of null customer data
  - Improved error handling and user feedback

### 2. Created Test Customer Data

- **Features**:
  - Realistic Saudi names and phone numbers
  - Multiple orders per customer
  - Various order statuses (pending, processing, shipped, delivered)
  - Different price ranges (100-1100 SAR)
